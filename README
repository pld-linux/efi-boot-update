(U)EFI bootloaders updater
==========================

What is this for?
-----------------

(U)EFI systems boot using bootloaders on a special EFI System Partition.
Many different bootloaders may be present at a time. These are not only
traditional bootloaders like GRUB, but arbitrary 'EFI applications'.

Xen or Linux kernel can be built as an EFI application too and booted directly
from the EFI firmware. The problem is the kernels and data or config files
needed for boot must be stored on the EFI System Partition, but that is not
the place where they are installed on package upgrade. And it is hard to
install files from RPM packages there directly.

efi-boot-update script makes it easy to manage the files on the EFI system
partition. Those files are to be installed in the regular Linux system and
will be copied to the EFI system partition using rules defined in
/etc/efi-boot/update.d/*.conf files.

efi-boot-update will also manage EFI boot manager configuration, adding
the configured bootloaders to the platform boot menu, provided the 'efibootmgr'
package is installed and functional.
